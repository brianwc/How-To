# Introduction

* they provide a central, searchable place for people to find data
* some will automatically convert data from one format to others, so even though you can only provide CSV, it will generate XML, JSON, etc.
* some will visualize datasets right in the browser, letting people map, sort, search, and combine datasets, without knowing how to program
* some repositories can be syndicated, allowing other organizations to automatically incorporate your own data (e.g., a state transportation agency could gather up all localities' transportation data)
* you can either upload files to be stored in the repository or point the repository at an existing website address where the file lives

# Commercial Software

* no technical knowledge required
* they’ll hold your hand through the process
* your organization doesn’t have to provide any technical infrastructure
