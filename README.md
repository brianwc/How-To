# How to Publish Open Data

A practical guide to opening data, for government employees whose job it is to make that happen.

## To Do
* create a generic guide, which is to say that it doesn't provide information that's specific to any type of agency
 * both link to and incorporate materials (where licensing permits) from [5 ★ Open Data](http://5stardata.info/), [Simple Open Data](http://simpleopendata.com/), and [Philadephia's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kd4AOoRG8q18PVZ0JMusgKWJmgjrWvv3iTdKUjLEdT4/edit)
* create guides per agency
  * provide links to relevant software
  * document frequently used records management software within that type of agency
  * list datasets that they should publish
    * look at the OKFN open data census to compare datasets
* explain all common data formats, with links to software for conversion to other formats, and with a 5-star rating
 * PDF: really just fine for text, although maybe publish the original files (e.g., Word) alongside it, but not at all good for spreadsheets etc.
 * Word: really just fine for text, although Markdown, HTML, or RTF would be better
 * XML: very detailed, but complicated—classic example of an open format
 * JSON: lightweight, not hard to read or generate (CSV to JSON converter and vice-versa)
 * CSV: lightweight, a supermajority of people have software to read it, great for structured data
 * Excel: not as good as CSV, tough to parse, but so much better than a PDF
 * [and so on]
* provide a section on licensing
 * include a table of states and their position on the copyright status of government works (see [the Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_U.S._subnational_governments) for a head start on this
 * link to the [Open Government Data licensing page](http://theunitedstates.io/licensing/)
* provide only a very small section on policy guidelines
 * this guide is really for the folks in the trenches publishing data, rather than people setting policy, so it's really only necessary to send people to [Sunlight's policy guidelines](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/)
