# How to Publish Open Data

A guide for governments looking to publish open data.

[See Philadephia's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kd4AOoRG8q18PVZ0JMusgKWJmgjrWvv3iTdKUjLEdT4/edit).

* create a generic guide
* create guides per agency
  * provide links to relevant software
  * document frequently used records management software within that type of agency
  * list datasets that they should publish
    * look at the OKFN open data census to compare datasets
* explain all common data formats, with links to software for conversion to other formats
 * PDF: really just fine for text, although maybe publish the original files (e.g., Word) alongside it, but not at all good for spreadsheets etc.
 * Word: really just fine for text, although Markdown, HTML, or RTF would be better
 * XML: very detailed, but complicatedâ€”classic example of an open format
 * JSON: lightweight, not hard to read or generate (CSV to JSON converter and vice-versa)
 * CSV: lightweight, a supermajority of people have software to read it, great for structured data
 * Excel: not as good as CSV, tough to parse, but so much better than a PDF
 * [and so on]
* provide a section on licensing
 * include a table of states and their position on the copyright status of government works (see [the Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_U.S._subnational_governments) for a head start on this
